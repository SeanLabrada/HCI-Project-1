            <b>The Design Process</b>
        </div>
        <txt>We wanted to have a modern scrollable interface for our app, resembling other popular social media websites and apps. Ease of use and a clean design were some of our top priorities. We went through several prototype designs, starting with MS Paint mockups, moving to Figma to create higher fidelity prototypes.
            Initially we only had a rough idea of what we wanted for the design, deciding that we would have the user scroll through a list of events in a main feed, and that each event would have an RSVP option.
            We then decided that each event should also allow a link to other social media, and eventually we implemented Google Maps, so that businesses posting events could add directions.
