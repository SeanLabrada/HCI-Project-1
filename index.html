            <b>The Design Process</b>
        </div>
        <txt>We wanted to have a modern scrollable interface for our app, resembling other popular social media websites and apps. Ease of use and a clean design were some of our top priorities. We went through several prototype designs, starting with MS Paint mockups, moving to Figma to create higher fidelity prototypes</txt>

changed.     </h1>
